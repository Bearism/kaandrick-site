# KAANDRICK — Vibe‑Coded React Site

A one-command dev setup with Vite + Tailwind + Framer Motion + lucide-react.
Includes minimal headless UI primitives (Button, Card, Badge, Tabs, Input, Textarea, Tooltip, Separator).

## Quick Start
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Build
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Notes
- External image URLs in `App.jsx` are placeholders (Kendrick Lamar themed). Replace with your own assets as you wish.
- No shadcn/ui dependency — minimal components are included locally under `src/components/ui`.
